### Goa
It's a **Water Sport Heaven.** If you like water, Goa has it all. This Indian state stretches its **coastline** along the Arabian Sea, which means there's **plenty of beach to go around.** You can experience scuba diving or snorkeling in the sea, go on a sport fishing tour, try kitesurfing, and so much more.
